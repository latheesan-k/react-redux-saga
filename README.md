This project was inspired after a friend of mine from work recommended a video on _Scaling React.js Applications_ by _Max Stoiber_, which can be found [here](https://vimeo.com/168648012).

In this project, I aim to:

- [x] Use redux/react-redux
- [x] Use redux-sagas
- [x] Learn about actions, reducers, sagas and redux store
- [x] Integrate with react devtools
- [x] Structure the project using folder by feature
- [x] Separate presentation from logic using components and containers
